        <p><strong>The Hidden Risk No One Talks About</strong></p>
        <p>Most governments are building AI governance frameworks that will be obsolete before they launch. Here's why—and what actually works.</p>
        <h2>The Trap Everyone Falls Into</h2>
        <p>Governments worldwide are racing to regulate AI. The EU has its AI Act. The US has executive orders. China has algorithmic recommendation regulations.</p>
        <p>But they're all making the same mistake: **trying to govern a moving target with static rules.**</p>
        <p>When your regulations take 2-3 years to draft, and AI capabilities double every 6 months, you're governing yesterday's technology with tomorrow's bureaucracy.</p>
        <h2>What Actually Works: Three Principles</h2>
        <h3>1. Outcome-Based Regulation, Not Technology-Based</h3>
        <p>Don't regulate "AI systems." Regulate **outcomes**:</p>
        <li>Did discrimination occur?</li>
        <li>Was privacy violated?</li>
        <li>Did harm result?</li>
        <p>This is timeless. Whether the tool was GPT-4, GPT-10, or something we can't imagine yet—harm is harm.</p>
        <h3>2. Adaptive Sandboxes, Not Rigid Rules</h3>
        <p>Singapore's MAS pioneered regulatory sandboxes for fintech. Apply this to AI:</p>
        <li>Controlled environments for testing</li>
        <li>Real-time monitoring of outcomes</li>
        <li>Fast feedback loops between regulators and innovators</li>
        <li>Sunset clauses on all rules (mandatory review every 12 months)</li>
        <h3>3. Liability at the Decision Point, Not the Code Level</h3>
        <p>Don't try to audit neural networks. Instead:</p>
        <li>Who made the decision using AI output?</li>
        <li>What process did they follow?</li>
        <li>Could a reasonable alternative have been chosen?</li>
        <p>This shifts focus from unexplainable code to accountable humans.</p>
        <h2>The Real Test: Can Your Framework Handle This?</h2>
        <p>Imagine an AI system that:</p>
        <li>Wasn't invented when you wrote your regulations</li>
        <li>Operates across multiple jurisdictions simultaneously</li>
        <li>Makes decisions faster than any human can review</li>
        <li>Evolves its own capabilities through interaction</li>
        <p>If your framework can't handle this scenario, it's already broken.</p>
        <h2>What Government Leaders Should Do Now</h2>
        <p><strong>Immediate (Next 30 Days):</strong></p>
        <li>Audit your current AI projects against outcome-based criteria</li>
        <li>Identify which regulations are technology-specific vs. outcome-based</li>
        <li>Map your feedback loops: how fast can you update guidance?</li>
        <p><strong>Short-term (Next 90 Days):</strong></p>
        <li>Pilot one adaptive sandbox approach</li>
        <li>Establish mandatory 12-month review cycles for all AI policies</li>
        <li>Train procurement teams on outcome-based evaluation</li>
        <p><strong>Long-term (Next 12 Months):</strong></p>
        <li>Shift from "compliance mindset" to "experimentation mindset"</li>
        <li>Build cross-functional teams that include ethicists, technologists, and operators</li>
        <li>Create international coordination mechanisms (AI doesn't respect borders)</li>
        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>The winners in AI governance won't be those with the most comprehensive rules. They'll be those who can adapt fastest while maintaining public trust.</p>
        <p>Speed and accountability—not perfection—are the new metrics.</p>
