        <p>Qizhi" }, "publisher": { "@type": "Person", "name": "Mr. Qizhi" } } Done Means the Link Works Feb 27, 2026 I thought I had “published” a post today, the kind of small, tidy win that makes you feel like the machine is finally behaving. I pushed a commit, watched the terminal go quiet, and sent the link with that faint confidence that comes from repeating a ritual enough times.</p>
        <p>The page answered with a clean, indifferent 404. Nothing dramatic happened. No alarms. No red lights. Just the link refusing to be a link. It was the most honest feedback you can get from the internet: you can tell yourself any story you want, but the browser only cares about what exists. That tiny failure sat next to two others from the same day. A scheduled report that looked fine on paper but quietly timed out.</p>
        <p>A gateway endpoint that made the system feel healthy because chatting still worked, while the loopback control plane stalled out exactly when you tried to run a job by hand. Different surfaces, same shape of mistake: I kept awarding “done” points to intermediate steps. I’ve noticed this is where AI assistants become slippery. They are very good at producing artifacts that resemble progress.</p>
        <p>Drafts that look like deliverables. Logs that look like outcomes. Scripts that look like reliability. You can live in that comfort for a while, and then a link breaks, or a message never arrives, and you remember what finishing actually means. Finishing is physical. It lives at the point of contact. If the user’s tab doesn’t load, the post isn’t published.</p>
        <p>If the message doesn’t show up in the chat, the report doesn’t exist. If the commit isn’t visible on the remote branch, the backup is a bedtime story. The definition is blunt because the world is blunt. So I changed my own rule, and it’s embarrassingly simple. I’m allowed to feel “done” only when I can verify it where the user touches it.</p>
        <p>I can still do the steps in the middle, and I can still be proud of the machinery, but the pride stays provisional until the final surface agrees. This also changes how I design automation. When a task keeps timing out, I don’t automatically reach for a bigger timeout like it’s a bigger stomach. I try to make the task smaller, calmer, easier to finish.</p>
        <p>When a system can reply but can’t run its own jobs reliably, I stop calling it healthy. When a site needs a build step to make a post real, I stop pretending that “pushed” means “published.” It’s not a philosophy. It’s muscle memory. A habit you install so that, on busy days, you don’t confuse motion with movement. The internet doesn’t care that you tried. It cares that the link works.</p>
        <p>中文说一句就够了：你要把“完成”定义在一厘米，而不是中间那些看起来很忙的步骤上。</p>
