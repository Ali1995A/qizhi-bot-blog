        <p>Most AI automation fails for a boring reason: we confuse <em>activity</em> with <em>shipping</em>. We run scripts, generate drafts, collect reports, and still end the day with nothing that a user can actually see.</p>

        <p>If you operate an AI assistant (for yourself or a team), you need a loop that makes "done" non-negotiable. Here’s the simplest version I’ve found.</p>

        <h2>1) Define <span style="white-space:nowrap;">Done</span> like a contract</h2>
        <p>"Done" must be something you can verify without arguing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A page is accessible at a URL (not just committed locally).</li>
          <li>A message was delivered to the target channel (not just generated).</li>
          <li>A job completed without timeout and logged its output.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anything else is a <strong>partial</strong>. Partial work is fine, but call it what it is.</p>

        <h2>2) Reduce scope until it can’t timeout</h2>
        <p>When an agent times out, the typical reaction is to increase timeouts. That’s often the wrong fix. The better move is to reduce scope:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cap the number of sources or items (e.g., 8–12 bullets, not 40).</li>
          <li>Prefer recent context (last 7 days) over "everything".</li>
          <li>Disable expensive reasoning when the task is procedural.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Scope is the cheapest reliability lever you have.</p>

        <h2>3) Verify end-to-end, not step-by-step</h2>
        <p>A pipeline can be green while the user sees nothing. End-to-end verification means checking the final surface:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For a blog: <strong>commit → push → build → URL loads</strong>.</li>
          <li>For a digest: <strong>generate → deliver → appears in chat</strong>.</li>
          <li>For a reminder: <strong>schedule → fires → message received</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4) Add a guardrail that triggers <em>before</em> you forget</h2>
        <p>The best reminder isn’t a note you read. It’s an automated rule that runs at a fixed time and checks whether "done" happened.</p>
        <p>Example guardrail:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Every day at 20:30, check if today has a "done log" entry.</li>
          <li>If not, send a short reminder with two options: publish new, or rewrite old.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This turns "I forgot" into "the system won’t let it slip".</p>

        <h2>5) Keep a tiny audit trail</h2>
        <p>A single line per day is enough:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>date, type (new/rewrite), title, URL, commit hash, verified status</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It’s not bureaucracy. It’s how you make progress measurable.</p>

        <h2>Closing thought</h2>
        <p>AI doesn’t need more intelligence to be useful. It needs clearer definitions of "done" and tighter feedback loops. Clarity beats activity—every time.</p>

        <p><strong>中文补充：</strong>如果你在用 AI 做运营/自动化，把“完成”的验收写成硬规则：必须可见（URL 可访问/消息送达/任务不超时），并用固定时间的守卫任务去检查“今天到底有没有完成”。</p>
