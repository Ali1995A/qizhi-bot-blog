      <div class="post-content">
        <p>In 2026, “we’re piloting AI” usually means one of two things. Either the team is genuinely improving services with automation and better decisions — or the team is stuck in a loop of demos, vendor decks, and nervous approvals that never make it to production.</p>

        <p>I’ve sat in the meetings where both realities collide: the contact-center lead wants a chatbot live before the next peak season; the legal team wants a risk assessment; security wants logs and access control; procurement wants a contract template; and the data team quietly asks, “Who owns the model performance after go-live?”</p>

        <p>This post is how I’d build <strong>AI governance</strong> for a digital government program today — not as a policy document, but as an <strong>operating system</strong>. Something that helps you ship faster <em>and</em> reduces risk.</p>

        <h2>Start with a simple promise: governance should make delivery easier</h2>
        <p>When governance is done well, teams stop re-litigating the same arguments on every project. They know:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What kinds of AI are allowed (and what is off-limits).</li>
          <li>Which controls are “always on” versus “only for high-risk use.”</li>
          <li>Who has decision rights at each stage (and how to escalate fast).</li>
          <li>What evidence to produce so security, legal, and leadership can approve with confidence.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When governance is done poorly, it becomes theatre: a checklist nobody believes, or a committee that says “no” without offering a path to “yes.”</p>

        <h2>A story you’ll recognize: the citizen chatbot that nearly became a liability</h2>
        <p>Imagine a citizen services bot on the main portal. The intention is good: reduce wait time, answer FAQs, help people find the right form, and route complex cases to humans.</p>

        <p>Then reality arrives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A citizen asks a benefit eligibility question. The bot answers confidently, but slightly wrong.</li>
          <li>Someone pastes a malicious prompt and tries to extract internal instructions.</li>
          <li>A staff member uses the bot to draft an email and accidentally includes sensitive personal data.</li>
          <li>The model provider changes something upstream. Suddenly the refusal behavior is different.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>None of these are exotic. They are normal operational problems. That’s why I frame AI governance around one idea: <strong>treat AI as a living service, not a one-time IT project</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Before controls, name the risk class (this ends 80% of arguments)</h2>
        <p>Most governance disputes happen because teams argue about safeguards without agreeing what kind of system they’re building.</p>

        <p>I use a very practical classification that aligns to how close the system is to real-world consequences:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Assistive systems:</strong> help staff draft, summarize, translate, search, or extract. A human reviews the output before action.</li>
          <li><strong>Operational systems:</strong> influence workflow and prioritization (e.g., “inspect these 50 cases first,” “flag these documents”). Humans still decide, but the AI shapes attention.</li>
          <li><strong>Decisional systems:</strong> directly affect rights, benefits, enforcement, or access. These deserve the strictest governance and the clearest appeal path.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>My rule of thumb: <strong>the closer you are to a binding decision, the more you need traceability, mandatory review, and an appeal mechanism</strong>. If you can’t explain to a citizen how a decision was made, you are not ready to automate that decision.</p>

        <h2>The five-part operating model I’ve found durable</h2>
        <p>Instead of an “AI policy” sitting on a shelf, I prefer five layers that map to how government work actually happens:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Policy:</strong> allowed uses, prohibited uses, and what you consider “high risk.”</li>
          <li><strong>Controls:</strong> privacy, security, fairness, robustness, and human oversight — translated into concrete requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Lifecycle:</strong> how projects move from idea → build → test → deploy → monitor → retire (with gates that create evidence, not paperwork).</li>
          <li><strong>Procurement:</strong> contract clauses that preserve auditability and prevent lock-in.</li>
          <li><strong>Measurement:</strong> service outcomes (speed, satisfaction, accuracy) plus harm indicators (incidents, bias drift, policy violations).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you’re building a central GovTech AI capability, you can assign owners to each layer: policy with leadership/legal, controls with security and risk, lifecycle with your digital delivery office, procurement with commercial, and measurement with service owners.</p>

        <h2>The Minimum Control Set (MCS): what I would standardize across every AI project</h2>
        <p>The fastest governance win is to define a <strong>Minimum Control Set</strong> that every team uses — regardless of whether they’re building a document classifier, an LLM assistant, or a fraud model. The MCS turns governance from “debate” into “shared infrastructure.”</p>

        <p>Here’s a practical MCS I’d roll out:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data governance you can trace:</strong> dataset lineage, retention rules, PII handling, and a clear legal basis for use. (If someone asks “Where did this training/evaluation data come from?”, you should be able to answer in minutes, not weeks.)</li>
          <li><strong>Model and prompt oversight:</strong> versioning, change logs, evaluation suite, and a rollback plan. For LLM apps, treat prompts, retrieval configuration, and safety rules as first-class artifacts.</li>
          <li><strong>Human oversight by design:</strong> define who can override the system, when review is mandatory, and what evidence the reviewer sees. “Human in the loop” is meaningless unless it’s specified in the workflow.</li>
          <li><strong>Security as a feature:</strong> access controls, secrets handling, audit logging, and defenses for common LLM threats (prompt injection, data leakage, tool misuse). Make logging non-negotiable for production.</li>
          <li><strong>Fairness and impact checks:</strong> for Operational/Decisional systems, run bias tests and disparate-impact checks, and document mitigations. If you can’t test it, limit the scope or keep it assistive.</li>
          <li><strong>Transparency for citizens and staff:</strong> plain-language notices (“this is AI-assisted”), guidance on limitations, and internal documentation for operators.</li>
          <li><strong>Incident response that’s actually runnable:</strong> how staff report harmful outputs, how you triage, when you disable features, and who is on call.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Notice what’s missing: long philosophical arguments. The MCS is about repeatable execution.</p>

        <h2>What “good” looks like for an LLM in government (a concrete example)</h2>
        <p>Let’s go back to the citizen chatbot. If I wanted it safe enough to scale, I would structure it like this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Make it assistive by default:</strong> focus on navigation, FAQs, and “next best action” routing. Avoid binding decisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Ground answers in approved sources:</strong> retrieval over official policy pages, manuals, and service knowledge bases, with citations shown to the user where appropriate.</li>
          <li><strong>Design for uncertainty:</strong> when confidence is low, the bot should escalate to a human or guide the citizen to authoritative channels.</li>
          <li><strong>Separate public vs internal modes:</strong> internal staff assistants can access different tools and data, but must have stronger authentication, logging, and data-loss controls.</li>
          <li><strong>Red-team the obvious failures:</strong> test for unsafe advice, policy hallucinations, biased responses, and prompt injection attempts.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The goal isn’t perfection. The goal is <strong>predictability</strong>: when the bot fails, it fails safely, and your team can see it, fix it, and learn from it.</p>

        <h2>Procurement: write the contract like you expect change (because it will change)</h2>
        <p>Public-sector AI often fails not because the model is “bad,” but because the contract makes operations impossible. In 2026, I’d insist on clauses that assume the model and the vendor will evolve.</p>

        <p>At minimum, I’d push for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Audit rights:</strong> access to evaluation results, incident logs, and change history relevant to your deployment.</li>
          <li><strong>Model update notice:</strong> vendors must notify you of major changes and provide an impact assessment (or at least a release note + evaluation deltas you can validate).</li>
          <li><strong>Portability:</strong> export your data, your prompts, your evaluation suite, your configurations, and your logs. Don’t let “we can’t export that” become your lock-in.</li>
          <li><strong>SLAs tied to service outcomes:</strong> not just uptime. Include response quality signals (escalation rate, factuality checks, deflection quality) and incident response timelines.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you’re buying an LLM-based product, also clarify what happens with your data: retention, training use, and whether you can choose an isolated tenant. Ambiguity here turns into risk later.</p>

        <h2>Monitoring: the dashboard that saves you after launch</h2>
        <p>I treat monitoring as the moment governance becomes real. If you can’t observe the system, you’re just hoping.</p>

        <p>A useful production dashboard mixes service performance and risk indicators:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Service KPIs:</strong> first-contact resolution, average handling time, citizen satisfaction proxy, and backlog reduction.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality KPIs:</strong> policy compliance rate, citation/grounding rate (for retrieval systems), escalation rate, and sampled accuracy checks by humans.</li>
          <li><strong>Risk KPIs:</strong> privacy incidents, harmful content flags, jailbreak attempts, and drift indicators (bias drift, topic drift, performance drift).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The most important two decisions are operational:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stop-the-line thresholds:</strong> what triggers a feature to be paused (e.g., a sudden spike in incorrect eligibility guidance).</li>
          <li><strong>Rollback paths:</strong> how you revert a model/prompt/config safely, and who has the authority to do it quickly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>FAQ (the questions teams ask in the hallway)</h2>
        <p><strong>Can we deploy an LLM chatbot for citizen services safely?</strong><br>
        Yes — if you design it as primarily assistive, ground it in approved sources, escalate uncertain cases, and monitor like a live service.</p>

        <p><strong>Should AI make eligibility decisions?</strong><br>
        Treat that as decisional/high-risk. Use AI for evidence gathering and recommendation, but keep binding decisions, explanations, and appeals with humans unless your legal and operational framework is truly mature.</p>

        <p><strong>What’s the quickest governance win?</strong><br>
        Ship an MCS checklist + a reusable evaluation harness + an incident playbook. Once teams can reuse tooling and templates, governance stops feeling like friction.</p>
