        <h2>The real cause of Gov-Tech failure? It starts before the first line of code.</h2>
        <p>I've watched too many digital government projects fail—and the pattern is remarkably consistent. The vendor demo was polished. The proposal checked every box. The kickoff had catered lunch and a politician with oversized scissors. Six months later: missed deadlines, ballooning costs, and a system that nobody wants to use.</p>
        <p>The root cause isn't technical. It's contractual.</p>
        <p>Most Gov-Tech failures are <strong>procurement failures</strong>. The RFP asked for features; the contract rewarded milestones; the acceptance criteria were vague enough to drive a truck through. By the time anyone realized the system doesn't work in production, the money was spent and the vendor had moved on to the next RFP.</p>
        <p>This post is for procurement officers, IT directors, and political sponsors who are tired of buying expensive disappointments. Here's how to write contracts that force vendors to deliver systems that actually work.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 1: Buying features instead of outcomes</h2>
        <p>Traditional RFPs read like feature lists: "The system shall support user authentication," "The system shall provide reporting dashboards," "The system shall integrate with legacy databases." Vendors love this. Features are easy to demo. Outcomes are hard.</p>
        <p><strong>Better approach:</strong> Define what success looks like from the citizen's perspective.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Instead of: "The system shall include a portal for permit applications"</li>
          <li>Write: "Median time from application submission to approval decision: under 48 hours for 95% of standard permits"</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Instead of: "The system shall support online payment"</li>
          <li>Write: "Payment success rate >99.5%; failed transactions automatically trigger retry logic and customer notification within 15 minutes"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you specify outcomes, you force vendors to think about reliability, error handling, and user experience—not just checkbox compliance.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 2: Ignoring operability requirements</h2>
        <p>Most RFPs have pages about functionality and a paragraph about "support." This is backwards. The hard part of Gov-Tech isn't building the system—it's keeping it running when reality gets messy.</p>
        <p><strong>Required operability clauses (non-negotiable):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>SLOs with teeth:</strong> 99.9% uptime during business hours, measured monthly. Miss the SLO? Automatic penalty or termination right.</li>
          <li><strong>Incident response:</strong> P1 incidents (complete outage) require human acknowledgment within 15 minutes, 24/7. Include the escalation phone numbers in the contract.</li>
          <li><strong>Observability:</strong> Vendor provides real-time dashboards, log access, and alerting integration with your existing monitoring stack. No black boxes.</li>
          <li><strong>Runbooks:</strong> Complete operational documentation delivered before go-live, including failure modes, rollback procedures, and known issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Mistake 3: Paying for promises instead of delivery</h2>
        <p>Standard payment schedules front-load revenue: 30% at contract signing, 30% at design review, 30% at UAT, 10% at final acceptance. Vendors collect 90% of the money before the system faces real users.</p>
        <p><strong>Better payment structure:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>10% at contract (covers initial mobilization only)</li>
          <li>20% after successful production pilot with real users</li>
          <li>40% after 90 days of stable production operation (measured by SLOs)</li>
          <li>30% spread over years 2-3 as annual maintenance payments, contingent on continued performance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This aligns incentives. The vendor doesn't get paid for shipping code. They get paid for shipping <strong>working operations</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 4: Accepting vendor lock-in</h2>
        <p>Proprietary formats, closed APIs, undocumented data models—these are deliberate strategies to make switching vendors prohibitively expensive. By year three, you're not evaluating whether the system works; you're calculating the cost of escape.</p>
        <p><strong>Anti-lock-in requirements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data portability:</strong> Complete data export in open formats (JSON, CSV, SQL dumps) available on demand, without vendor assistance, within 24 hours.</li>
          <li><strong>API documentation:</strong> Complete, current API docs with working examples. No "contact sales for integration details."</li>
          <li><strong>Open standards:</strong> Preference for solutions built on open standards (OAuth, OpenAPI, SAML, etc.) over proprietary protocols.</li>
          <li><strong>Source code escrow:</strong> For custom development, source code held in escrow by third party. If vendor goes bankrupt or abandons support, you get the code.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Mistake 5: Skipping the proof-of-concept phase</h2>
        <p>Big-bang procurements are high-risk bets. By the time you see working software, you've already committed millions and burned political capital.</p>
        <p><strong>Phased approach:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Discovery phase (4-6 weeks, fixed price):</strong> Vendor analyzes your environment, identifies integration risks, produces technical approach document. You pay for their expertise, not promises.</li>
          <li><strong>Proof of concept (8-12 weeks, capped price):</strong> Build one critical user journey end-to-end with production-like load testing. Evaluate actual performance, not slide decks.</li>
          <li><strong>Full build (competitive negotiation):</strong> Only vendors who passed PoC are invited to bid on full implementation, with realistic estimates based on actual experience with your systems.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This costs more upfront but eliminates the catastrophic risk of discovering fundamental mismatches six months into a multi-year project.</p>

        <h2>A practical RFP checklist</h2>
        <p>Before releasing your next Gov-Tech RFP, verify:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>☐ Success metrics are defined in terms of citizen outcomes, not system features</li>
          <li>☐ SLOs include specific availability targets, measurement methods, and penalty clauses</li>
          <li>☐ Payment schedule ties majority of revenue to production performance, not milestones</li>
          <li>☐ Data portability and API access requirements are specified</li>
          <li>☐ Incident response times and escalation procedures are contractually binding</li>
          <li>☐ Acceptance criteria include load testing with realistic peak traffic</li>
          <li>☐ Training, documentation, and knowledge transfer are deliverables with defined completeness standards</li>
          <li>☐ Contract includes termination rights if SLOs are repeatedly missed</li>
          <li>☐ Intellectual property ownership is clearly specified (especially for custom development)</li>
          <li>☐ Security and compliance requirements reference specific standards (SOC 2, ISO 27001, FedRAMP, etc.) with audit rights</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The cultural shift</h2>
        <p>Better procurement requires procurement officers who understand technology and technologists who understand contracting. The worst outcomes happen when these groups don't talk—when lawyers write specs they don't understand, or when engineers accept contracts they haven't read.</p>
        <p>The best Gov-Tech organizations embed technical evaluators in procurement teams and give them veto power. They treat vendor selection as a strategic partnership decision, not a compliance exercise. And they measure success by whether citizens' lives actually get easier—not by whether the project launched on schedule.</p>

        <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> You can't contract your way out of bad requirements, but you can certainly contract your way into predictable failure. The difference is in the details—and in having the discipline to enforce them.</p>
